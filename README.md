# Todo
- look into how the context works (https://golang.org/pkg/context/) and if I need it
- tests
- add doc strings in code
- discuss setting up from scratch
  - where it looks for credentials, etc
  - verbose/ test command to ensure creds are found and working
- add to homebrew and mention that as an installation method
- mention how to build from source (using go modules)
- switch from region to profile flag
- make it harder to mess up source and destination queues

# Future Work
- allow custom visibility timeout (command line flag)
- allow configurable long polling wait time
- explanatory readme of SQS best practices and gotchas
  - messages timeing out during redrive and reappearing
  - messages disappearing after 14 days
- explain SQS concepts
  - default visibility timeout
  - message retention period
  - delivery delay
  - receive message wait time
  - redrive policy (dlq, max receives)
  - FIFO queue (not currently supported)
- explanation of permissions needed to run
- config file (to alias commonly redriven queues)
- parallelism configuration
- output redriven messages to a file
- filtering during redrive
- keep track of redriven messages and stop once we only see duplicate messages
- ability to keep running even when the queue is empty?
- find forums, stackoverflow questions, etc where people are asking about redriving SQS messages and respond with tool usage
- compile and publish releases (to github) for other platforms (supported by go)
- use profiler to speed up critical path
